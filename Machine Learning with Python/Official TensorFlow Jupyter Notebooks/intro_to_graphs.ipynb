    "In the previous three guides, you ran TensorFlow **eagerly**. This means TensorFlow operations are executed by Python, operation by operation, and returning results back to Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "While eager execution has several unique advantages, graph execution enables portability outside Python and tends to offer better performance. **Graph execution** means that tensor computations are executed as a *TensorFlow graph*, sometimes referred to as a `tf.Graph` or simply a \"graph.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Graphs are data structures that contain a set of `tf.Operation` objects, which represent units of computation; and `tf.Tensor` objects, which represent the units of data that flow between operations.** They are defined in a `tf.Graph` context. Since these graphs are data structures, they can be saved, run, and restored all without the original Python code.\n",
