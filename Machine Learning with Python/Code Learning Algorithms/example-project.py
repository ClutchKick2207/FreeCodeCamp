#---README---

# I decided to have a pure Python file in this folder for the example Titanic Project
# So that you can look at the code all in one place

#I'll put in a few notes in here as well.

#---Start of Code---

#Importing the required libraries;

import numpy as np #For manipulation of datasets, and general tools
import pandas as pd #For neater and more efficient dataset usage
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #for plotting
from IPython.display import clear_output
from six.moves import urllib
