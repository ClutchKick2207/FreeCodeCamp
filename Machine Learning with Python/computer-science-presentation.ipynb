    "* *\"The effort to automate intellectual tasks, normally performed by humans\"*\n",

    "* Tic-Tac-Toe\n",

    "* \"A form of Machine Learning, that uses a layered representation of Data\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning relies on different *'nodes'* (often referred to as '*neurons*'), which all hold a unique, partially computed state, with the basic logic and data flow between these nodes being regulated via *'weightings'*. This allows for simple logic between nodes, using things such as *'if'* gates, *'and'* gates and *'or'* gates to choose if it will progress through the layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Changing and adjusting these weightings allows for a neural network to optimise the output and be more accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes more specifically changes the data with a set of pre-defined rules, of which can also be adjusted in tandem with the weightings between them. A simple way to visualise this would be to look at it as a large network of 'AI' models communcating with each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this processing occurs within a set of *'hidden layers'*, with inputs coming in through an *'input layer'*, and being collated into a set of meaningful data and ouputed via an *'output layer'*.\n",
