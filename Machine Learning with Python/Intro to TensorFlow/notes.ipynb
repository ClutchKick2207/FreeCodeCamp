    "* \"A '***tensor***' is a generalisation of vectors and matrices to potentially higher dimensions. Internally, TensorFlow represents tensors as '***n-dimensional arrays of base datatypes***'\n",
    "* Tensors are a fundamental part of 'TensorFlow' (therefore the name), as Tensors are passed around and manipulated throughout the program. Each tensor represents a partially define computation that will eventially output a value. Tensorflow programs work by building a graph of Tensor objects that details how tensors are related. Running different parts of this graph allow for different results to be generated."
