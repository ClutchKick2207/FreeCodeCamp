    "  * 'Very good AI' simply consisted of a 'very good' set of rules, usually being more exhaustive, and taking into account more situations.\n",
    "  * AI has the ability to be both very simple and incredibly complex, depending on how many 'rules' are implemented in the development of the AI\n",

    "      * The ghosts are pre-programed to attempt to find the shortest possible path to 'Pacman' in order to catch it, although it involves a character with slower movement speed.\n",

    "  * Main reason that Machine Learning models do not have a 100% accuracy, is due to the more open ended creation of rules (considering that the program makes it themselves)\n",
