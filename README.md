# FreeCodeCamp Course Notes

I'll be using this repository to hosue all of the notes that I take during my time taking the official FreeCodeCamp courses, and aim to get the classic 'Full Stack Developer' certification as a form of gaining experience in multiple languages, and seeing what suits me best.

## Progress:

This table will indicate which courses I am currently working on, for easier reference as to what is finished, and what I am still working on. Will update as I go through more courses.

## Where to find all my notes?

Just go into source code, and everything will be sorted into notes for each lesson, and a document with the answer for each lesson. As I start doing some responses for a certification, I'll upload those on here as well.
