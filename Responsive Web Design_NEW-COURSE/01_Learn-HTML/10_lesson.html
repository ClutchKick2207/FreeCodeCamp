<!--
    Question/Info:

    You can link to another page with the anchor (a) element. For example, <a href='https://freecodecamp.org'></a> would link to freecodecamp.org.
    Add an anchor element after the paragraph that links to https://freecatphotoapp.com. At this point, the link wonâ€™t show up in the preview.
