    Question/Info:

    Commenting allows you to leave messages without affecting the browser display. It also allows you to make code inactive. A comment in HTML starts with <!--, contains any number of lines of text, and ends with -->. For example, the comment <!-- TODO: Remove h1 --> contains the text TODO: Remove h1.
    Add a comment above the p element with the text TODO: Add link to cat photos.

    Some Notes:
