<!--
There are many different types of elements that can be used, including the following which can label importance, and more importantly how large each element is on a web-page
-->

<!--
Here are all of the tags which you can use for headers:
-->

<h1>This is very large</h1>
<h2>This is a bit smaller</h2>
<h3>This is a bit smaller than before</h3>
<h4>This is still getting smaller</h4>
<h5>This is about as small as you want to go for a heading...</h5>
<h6>I think you get the point by this point, these headings are able to get infintely smaller, although by convention stop here</h6>
