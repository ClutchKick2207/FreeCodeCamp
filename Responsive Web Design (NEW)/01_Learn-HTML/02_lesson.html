<!--
    Question/Info:

    The h1 to h6 heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them. The lower the number, the higher the importance, so h2 elements have less importance than h1 elements. Only use one h1 element per page and place lower importance headings below higher importance headings.
    Add an h2 element below the h1 element that says Cat Photos.
-->

<!-- Final Answer -->
<html>
    <body>
        <h1> CatPhotoApp </h1>
        <h2> Cat Photos </h2>
    </body>
</html>

    Some Notes:

    HTML is made from different tags, with some examples being the headings (such as <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <p>, <img>, etc.)
    This allows for the browser to render the different information with different styles
